- Establishes a connection to the device
- Sends commands to request battery information
- Processes responses to determine battery level and charging status
- Updates the system tray icon accordingly

## Troubleshooting

1. **Mouse Not Detected**
   - Ensure the mouse is properly connected
   - Try unplugging and reconnecting the device
   - Check if the device appears in Windows Device Manager

2. **Permission Issues**
   - Run the application with administrator privileges
   - Verify user permissions for HID devices
